# dcndp-models
Python implementation of models for the distance-based critical node detection problem.


The folder named "Generalised-DCNDP" contains codes and network instances for the generalised DCNDP (DCNDP on edge-weighted networks) for the book chapter "Modeling and Exact Solution Approaches for the Distance-Based Critical Node and Edge Detection Problems".


The folder "dcndp-heuristics" contains the code and network instances used in the paper  "A heuristic approach for the distance-based critical node detection problem in complex networks" which can be found at https://doi.org/10.1080/01605682.2021.1913078. The file "random_networks.zip" contains different classes of synthetic networks used in  paper as follows:
ba-Barabasi Albert networks; 
er- Erdos Renyi networks; 
gnm-Uniform random networks;
benchmark- the larger instances equivalent to the benchmark instances used in previous literature on the CNDP
