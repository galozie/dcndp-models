# dcndp-models
Python implementation of models for the distance-based critical node detection problem.
The folder named "Generalised-DCNDP" contains codes and network instances for the generalised DCNDP (DCNDP on edge-weighted networks) for the book chapter "Modeling and Exact Solution Approaches for the Distance-Based Critical Node and Edge Detection Problems".
The folder "dcndp-heuristics" contains the code and network instances used in the publication "A heuristic approach for the distance-based critical node detection problem in complex networks" which can be found at "https://doi.org/10.1080/01605682.2021.1913078".
